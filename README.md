## Date and Time
Dart offers utilities for working with dates and times, including classes for representing dates, times, durations, and intervals.

```dart
DateTime now = DateTime.now();
print(now);
```

## Async Programming
Asynchronous programming in Dart allows you to execute non-blocking operations, which is crucial for handling tasks such as network requests, file I/O, and other operations that may take time to complete.
```dart
void main() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
        print('Hello World!');
    });
}
```

## Enums
Enums, short for enumerations, are a feature in many programming languages, including Dart. In Dart, enums are a special type used to represent a fixed number of constant values, typically related to a specific domain or set of options.

```dart
enum Direction {
  up,
  down,
  left,
  right
}
```
